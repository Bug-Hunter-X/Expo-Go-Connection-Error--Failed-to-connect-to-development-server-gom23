The solution typically involves several steps:

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device and your development machine are on the same network and have a stable internet connection.  Restart both devices if needed.
2. **Verify Firewall Settings:** Make sure that your firewall (both on your development machine and possibly your network router) is not blocking connections to ports 19000-19002.  You may need to temporarily disable the firewall for testing purposes.
3. **Correct IP Address:** If your device and your development machine are on the same network but on different subnets, use your machine's local IP address (not localhost) instead of localhost when running Expo Start. You can find your local IP address via your machine's network settings. 
4. **Expo Start Command:** Use the correct command:  Ensure you run `expo start --lan` to start the server. 
5. **Check for conflicts:**  Ensure that no other application is running on the required ports (19000-19002). 
6. **Restart Expo Go:** Close and reopen the Expo Go app. If problems persist, try restarting your computer and phone. 
7. **Check for typos** Double check the IP you entered in Expo Go does not have any typos.

If the problem persists, check the Expo documentation for more advanced troubleshooting steps.  There could be problems with your network configuration, or an issue with the Expo CLI or the app itself.
