# Expo Go Connection Error: Failed to connect to development server

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo Go: failure to connect to the development server. The problem is often related to network configuration, firewall restrictions, or incorrect IP addressing. This repo provides code examples that illustrate the problem and its solution.

## Problem

When launching an Expo app with Expo Go, a connection error occurs, preventing the app from loading properly. This is usually indicated by messages related to network issues or failure to connect to the development server.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying network connectivity, checking firewall settings to ensure that the development server's port (usually 19000-19002) is accessible, and confirming that the correct IP address (either localhost or your machine's IP address) is used in the Expo Go app's configuration.
