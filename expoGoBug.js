This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application and it fails to connect to the development server.  The error message may vary, but it often points to network connectivity issues or problems with the development server itself.  A common cause is the Expo Go app not being able to find your local development server on your network, which is usually due to incorrect IP address configuration or network firewalls blocking the connection.
